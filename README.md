# Using this tool

We use this tool locally to generate the algorithm graphs (and possibly will host it publicly in the future)

## Can I self host?
Yeah feel free to self host if you want to generate the algorithm graphs yourself to interact with them. Please do not host this on the internet or use this for anything besides locally hosting for the sake of generating the graphs.

### How to self host?
Get the project into a folder on your computer
Open in your terminal or something like VSC
use npm, bun, yarn, pnpm, or your ideal package manager. We used NPM but we typically use pnpm or bun
Run npm i (replace NPM with your package manager cmd)
then start it and visit the URL!
